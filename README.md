## 🌟 About the Project

This project is a **multilingual portfolio website** designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a Full-Stack Developer. It supports multiple languages and ensures a seamless user experience with proper SEO optimization.

The site is built using:
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**
- **Three.js** for 3D animations
- **Charming.js** for text morphing effects
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

---

## ✨ Features

- **Multilingual Support**: Automatically redirects users based on their browser language (English, French, Arabic, German).
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for all devices and screen sizes.
- **SEO Optimization**: Includes meta tags, Open Graph tags, Twitter cards, hreflang tags, and schema markup.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Provides manual language selection if JavaScript is disabled.
- **3D Animations**: Interactive 3D objects powered by Three.js.
- **Text Morphing**: Dynamic text animations using Charming.js.
- **Favicons**: Comprehensive favicon setup for all devices and browsers.

---

## 🌐 Languages Supported

The portfolio is available in the following languages:
- **English** (`/en/`)
- **French** (`/fr/`)
- **Arabic** (`/ar/`) (RTL support)
- **German** (`/de/`)

Each language version includes localized content, metadata, and SEO tags.

---

## 🔍 SEO Optimization

The site is fully optimized for search engines with:
- **Meta Tags**: Descriptions, keywords, and author information.
- **Open Graph Tags**: For social media sharing (Facebook, LinkedIn).
- **Twitter Cards**: For Twitter sharing.
- **Hreflang Tags**: For multilingual SEO.
- **Schema Markup**: Structured data for search engines.
- **Canonical URLs**: Prevents duplicate content issues.
- **Sitemap**: Helps search engines index all pages.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Redirection Logic**:
   - The root `index.html` detects the user's browser language and redirects them to the appropriate language folder (`/en/`, `/fr/`, `/ar/`, `/de/`).
   - If JavaScript is disabled, fallback links allow manual navigation.

2. **3D Animations**:
   - Two rotating 3D objects (Octahedron and Icosahedron) are rendered using Three.js.
   - The objects dynamically resize based on the screen dimensions for responsiveness.

3. **Text Morphing**:
   - The title text animates with random characters before settling into the final text using Charming.js.

---
