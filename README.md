## 🌟 About the Project

This project is a **multilingual portfolio website** designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a Full-Stack Developer. It supports multiple languages and ensures a seamless user experience with proper SEO optimization.

The site is built using:
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**
- **Three.js** for 3D animations
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

---

## ✨ Features

- **SEO Optimization**: Includes meta tags, Open Graph tags, Twitter cards, hreflang tags, and schema markup.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Provides manual language selection if JavaScript is disabled.
- **Language Preference Storage**: Remembers user's language preference using localStorage.

## 🔍 SEO Optimization

- **Meta Tags**: Descriptive title, description, and keywords for each language.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Redirection Logic**:
   - The root `index.html` detects the user's browser language and redirects them to the appropriate language folder (`/en/`, `/fr/`, `/ar/`, `/de/`).
   - User language preferences are stored in localStorage for future visits.
   - If JavaScript is disabled, fallback links allow manual navigation.

2. **Multilingual Structure**:
   - Each language has its own directory with localized content.
   - The Arabic version includes RTL support with appropriate styling.
   - All versions share common assets (CSS, JavaScript, images).

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Inline critical CSS for faster initial rendering.
   - Preconnect to domains for faster resource loading.
   - Optimized SVG icons for social media links.
